EFFOcc: A Minimal Baseline for EFficient Fusion-based 3D Occupancy Network

## Demo videos
We provide lidar-camera occupancy prediction video of Occ3D-nuScenes dataset.

## Data Setup
We follow the setups of BEVDet(https://github.com/HuangJunJie2017/BEVDet) for data preprocessing of nuScenes dataset.



## Abstract（TL DR）
EFFOcc explores towards the minimal (minimal computation costs and minimal label costs) baseline for fast and high-performance 3D occupancy prediction with lidar-camera fusion. We show lightweight BEV-based fusion occnet can perform as well as voxel-based fusion occnets.
